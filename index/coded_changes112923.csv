This can increase the regulatory burden for businesses dealing in these types of securities, specifically in terms of compliance with registration and disclosure laws. Financial intermediaries may also have to perform more stringent due diligence when offering these securities to the public.",1

The change eases the restrictions on investment activities of insurance companies, thus providing them with more options for investment diversification. This could potentially positively impact investment returns, but it may also expose them to new risks associated with investing in foreign bonds and notes.",-1

This provides potential financial stability for these companies from secure, interest-earning deposits but doesn't substantially alter securities laws or regulations under Blue Sky laws. This change could increase investment activity by financial intermediaries in Georgia but doesn't necessarily increase or decrease state regulatory oversight.",0
4,109,1953,3,5,idaho,"Brokers and investment companies dealing in securities, other than exempt securities, must be licensed by the Idaho Department of Finance. Under provisions of the law prior to amendment, brokers and investment companies dealing in securities other than bonds of the United States, the State of Idaho or Idaho municipal corporations were required to be licensed. The amendment also increased fees. The fee for agent's license was increased from $10.00 to $20.00 per year and the fee for filing semi-annual statements of investment companies was increased from $5.00 to $10.00 for each statement.","Broker/Dealer, Fees",No,More,"The amendment to Idaho's securities law expands the licensing requirement to brokers and investment companies dealing in securities beyond U.S. and Idaho bonds and municipal corporations, demonstrating increased stringency. Additionally, this revision also implements increased licensing fees and semi-annual statement filing fees, potentially raising the cost of investment and business operations in the state. This suggests a higher supervisory position by the state over securities dealings, which could likely affect the risk-taking propensity of the brokers and investment companies.",1
5,110,1953,3,12,indiana,"The Indiana Legislature has authorized the use and distribution of identifying statements for which a registration statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Before an identifying statement may be used it must first be approved by the Indiana Securities Commission. The filing fee is $25.00, which may be applied to the payment of any fees required in connection with the filing of an application for registration of the securities. Provisions applicable to identifying statements are also applicable to a proposed form of prospectus. The use and distribution of a proposed form of prospectus were authorized by the law prior to amendment.","Registration, Fees, Disclosure",No,More,"The amendment to the Indiana Legislature adds greater stringency to the registration and disclosure process for securities offerings. Approval from the Indiana Securities Commission for identifying statements further enhances the oversight and procedural rigour, therefore increasing the administrative burden for businesses. Additionally, despite the nominal filing fee of $25.00, this change may deter potential issuers owing to the uncertainty of outcome and time involved, thus impacting the ease of capital raising for businesses.",1

The amendment, effective July 1, 1953, also amended provisions in respect to insurance carried on buildings which have been mortgaged to secure funds loaned by the insurance company.",Other,Yes,More,"The amendment restricts North Dakota insurance companies' investment choices, limiting them to real estate within the state, states where they are licensed, or any contiguous state. This narrows down the scope of secured investment options and could potentially reduce risk exposure. Additionally, the revision regarding insurance on mortgaged buildings implies tighter control over scenarios involving their own loaned funds.",1
7,112,1953,3,20,california,"The defendants were indicted for selling shares of stock without a permit from the California Commissioner of Corporations. The evidence showed that the company and its investors had contracted to form a corporation in the future. Since in a criminal prosecution it could not be assumed that any stock would be issued without a permit, the proof failed to establish the facts and circumstances necessary to constitute the crime charged.",Registration,No,More,"This incident emphasizes the criminal implications of selling shares without appropriate registration, thus increasing stringency of securities laws.

These amendments, however, do not appear to significantly alter the stringency of the regulation as they mainly clarify investment avenues and valuation protocols.

The fee for registration of a broker is fifty dollars.","Registration, Broker/Dealer, Fees",No,More,"This regulation enforces a more stringent requirement for oil and gas brokers in North Dakota. By mandating the brokers to register with the State Securities Commissioner, it enhances oversight and accountability. Plus, the brokers are required to provide a surety bond or cash deposit, thereby creating additional protection for investors.

This change in the law places a larger minimum capital requirement or surplus for policyholders needed by law, potentially limiting the scope of investments for domestic insurers. This could impact the financial intermediaries' investment strategies in New York, as the emphasis on named securities might redirect fund allocations towards these specific assets.",1

Promotional and related expenses cannot exceed 20% of the total capital.","Registration, Exemption, Disclosure",No,More,"The revised regulations impose greater restrictions and disclosure requirements for issuers of speculative and promotional securities. They mandate a 10% stock subscription by promoters before public offering and further restrictions on escrowed stock and dividends. This would mean enhanced compliance requirements and the potential limitation of capital-raising alternatives for businesses, while providing additional safeguards for investors.

15,114,1953,4,7,colorado,"Last November the Attorney General of Colorado ruled that the use of an identifying statement under Rule 132 of the SEC before the registration of securities in Colorado violates the provisions of the Colorado Securities Act. The Colorado Legislature has amended the law provision enumerating the transactions, that are subject to the Act to provide an exception which allows the issuance, publication or circulation of a preliminary form of prospectus, an identifying statement or other form of descriptive statement in the case of any security concerning which a registration statement is pending before the SEC.","Exemption, Registration",No,Less,"The recent amendment to the Colorado Securities Act brings about a measurable degree of leniency in terms of registration process. The new provision allows for an exception to the use of identifying statements even when a registration statement is pending before the SEC. This signifies that businesses and financial intermediaries now have fewer constraints on preliminary disclosures while their registration with the SEC is ongoing. The implications of this change may result in increased initial public offering activity in Colorado, as the preliminary distribution of prospects can attract potential investors earlier in the process.",-1

Each registered investment company shall notify the administrator promptly when it is not in compliance with any of the following requirements, and its registration statements shall be subject to revocation or suspension.,A. Investment Restrictions. The activities of the company shall be restricted in the following respects:,No diversified investment company shall purchase the securities of any issuer, excluding U.S. government securities, if by reason thereof the value of its investment in all securities of that issuer will exceed 5% of the value of its total assets.,Comment: Amendments made for clarification purposes only.,No investment company shall purchase any securities of the classes herein defined, if by reason thereof the value of its aggregate investment in such classes of securities will exceed the respective amounts set forth below:,20% of its total assets in securities which the company is restricted from selling to the public without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, provided that as to restricted equity securities the amount shall not exceed 10%;,Comment: Many corporate debt securities are not registered under the 1933 Act and thus not publicly traded. Yet, a  third  market is available where these securities may be sold in private transactions. The proposed amendment would relax the present limitation dealing with an investment company's purchase of restricted securities to permit the acquisition of a larger percentage of restricted securities, provided that restricted equity securities represent no more than 10 percent of the fund's total assets.,5% of its total assets in securities of unseasoned issuers, including their predecessors, which have been in operation for less than three years, and equity securities of issuers which are not readily marketable;,5% of its total assets in options, warrants, and any combination thereof; or,Comment: The words  options  and  warrants  were substituted for clarification only. There is no limitation placed on the writing of covered options.,10% of its total assets in the securities of real estate investment trusts or other investment companies, provided that investments in excess of 10% may be permitted by the administrator upon a showing that such investments involve no duplication of management or advisory fees.,Comment: This proposed provision is taken from the CSAC Statement of Policy on Closed-End Investment Companies. As in the closed-end policy, it is designed to prohibit the pyramiding of advisory fees.,No investment company shall invest in any of the following:,real estate or interests therein, excluding readily marketable securities;,commodities, commodity pools or commodity futures contracts, as de fined in the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974, or,interests in oil, gas, or other mineral exploration or development programs.,Comment: Minor language changes have been made for clarification. The restriction on investments in commodity pools has been added to cover this relatively new speculative investment vehicle.,The fundamental investment policies of the company shall be stated in the prospectus in reasonable detail and shall not be materially changed in any respect unless authorized by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the company.,B. Speculative Activities.

It is presumed that no such trading will occur unless the fund's yield is increased as a result of the trading.,The disclosure requirement relating to the purchase of restricted securities is amended to provide a specific percentage below which cover disclosure is not required.,The amendment in section B.4. is for clarification consistent with that in section A.2(c).,C. Expenses. The aggregate annual expenses of every character paid or incurred by an investment company, including management and advisory fees but excluding organizational costs, interest, taxes, brokerage comnuss1ons, and extraordinary expenses, whether such expenses are payable by the company or by its shareholders, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied, shall not exceed 2% of the first $10,000,000 of its net assets, 1Â½% of the next $20,000,000 of its net assets, and 1% of any additional net assets. The investment adviser or manager shall reimburse the investment company not less than annually for the amount by which such aggregate annual expenses exceed the amounts herein provided, up to an amount not exceeding its management and advisory fees for the period for which reimbursement is made, prior to publication of the company's annual report, and shall promptly notify the administrator if the aggregate expense limitation is exceeded by reason of any extraordinary expenses. The administrator may require the investment advisor or manager to maintain financial resources reasonably sufficient to enable it to meet its reimbursement obligation hereunder.,Comment: Two changes are proposed in this section. The addition of the words  organizational costs  is intended to clarify an existing ambiguity as to whether such expenses are to be covered by the expense limitation. The second amendment raises the expense limitation to a level approved by a number of CSAC members in June of 1975. Other CSAC member s presently permitting her expense limitations.

Redemption. All payments by an investment company upon redemption of securities of which it is the issuer shall be made in cash, except that the payments in cash by a company which has filed an election pursuant to Rule 18f-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 may be limited to the amount specified thereunder. The company shall give prompt written notice to the administrator of any member state prior to effecting any redemp.t ion in assets other than cash in that state, specifying the manner in which such redemption will be effected and the securities to be distributed upon redemption. The redemption fee payable by any shareholder shall not exceed 1% of the amount receivable upon redemption of his shares, except that if the shares of a company are sold without sales commission, the redemption fee shall not exceed 2% of such amount, subject to such conditions as the administrator may prescribe.,F. An investment company shall not effect any brokerage transactions in its portfolio securities with any broker dealer affiliated directly or indirectly with its adviser or manager.,Comment: The proposed deletion is consistent with the intendment of section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as created by the Securities Reform Act of 1975, which will prohibit most such transactions after May 1, 1978. This provision will be reconsidered after that date to determine whether it is necessary at all.,Subject to its adoption by administrative rule in those states where required, this policy shall be effective with respect to investment company registration statements, or amendments thereto increasing the amount offered thereunder, filed after the date of its publication, and with respect to all investment company registration statements one year after the date of its publication.,The policy text as presently effective appears at Â¶4856 of the  General Guide  division of the REPORTER.","Disclosure, Registration",No,More,"The proposed amendments enhance the regulation of foreign insurers and open-end investment companies by the Wyoming Insurance Commissioner and Central Securities Administrators Council, respectively, reinforcing disclosure requirements, risk mitigation parameters, and compliance procedures.

590,382,1969,5,5,california,"Anthony R. Pierno, California Commissioner of Corporations, today [April 27] announced the extension by emergency regulation of the deadline for qualifying securities for over-the-counter trading by securities brokers in California from May 1, 1969 to June 10, 1969.,The Commissioner also announced that the securities of foreign issuers (those organized outside the United States) would be exempted from qualification until August 28, 1969, to permit further study of the problems of qualifying such securities for public trading in the California secondary securities market.,The emergency regulations are pursuant to the new California securities law which was enacted by the 1968 legislature and went into effect on January 2, 1969. The new law requires that securities which are to be over-the-counter traded in California be qualified with the Commissioner. The regulation of the California over-the-counter market under the new law is designed to assure that California investors have access to adequate information concerning securities which are traded and to protect against the distribution and trading of fraudulent and inequitable securities.,The Commissioner noted that, while the early implementation of the new regulations is vital to the welfare of the California investing public, the large number of securities which must be qualified has presented difficulties to the securities industry and to investors which compel the postponement of the effective date of these regulations. The Department of Corporations has engaged in a campaign to publicize the new over-the-counter regulations to securities brokers and to acquaint them, with the requirements and procedures for qualifying securities in which they deal. The number of applications for qualification filed with the department indicates, however, that too many securities would have failed to qualify by the original deadÂ­ line. If securities are not qualified by the issuer or by the broker-dealer marketing them, not only are the securities barred from public trading in California but those securities brokers and security holders who violate the prohibition may be liable to the buyer for the purchase price or for damÂ­ ages. In addition, securities brokers may fail to meet the net capital requirements of the department when a portion of their securities inventory becomes ineligible for trading.,The additional time for qualification will be used by the Department of Corporations to further acquaint securities brokers and issuers of securities with the new rules and to obtain their compliance so as to minimize any disruption to normal securities trading.,Referring to the requirement that securities be qualified for over-the-counter trading in California, Commissioner Pierno indicated that the responsibility is primarily that of the company which issued the securities, though any securities broker or security holder may qualify them by filing the required information on the required form. Many securities which are traded over-the-counter are exempted from the need to qualify and many others have already been qualified. While most of those which have not yet qualified appear to be the smaller companies with but limited market in their securities, the extension of the deadline should prevent any unreasonable interference with the trading of securities. The Commissioner has called to the attention of securities brokers that securities which are not eligible for trading may not be acceptable to lenders as collateral.,Essentially, the new regulations relating to secondary trading of securities provide for making information available to investors regarding the management, business and financial condition of companies whose securities are being sold to the California public. The department considers that the issuer is best able to provide this information and that its procedures are easily complied with.,The postponement of the regulation of over-the-counter trading in the securities of foreign issuers outside the United States is necessitated by the need to give additional study to the unique problems presented by such securities. The securities of many Japanese corporations are held by Californians, for example, and differences of language and financial reporting practices are merely examples of the problems which require attention. These problems were not considered by the committee which drafted the new California securities law or by the legislature. The extension of the deadline for qualification of foreign securities will prevent an unreasonable interference with the trading of these securities while the matter of their regulation is under study. Noting that the United States Congress and the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission had studied this problem for several years before the present federal rules were enacted, Commissioner Pierno indicated that the groundwork at the federal level would assist in arriving at an appropriate California regulation.,While the Commissioner pointed out that every effort will be made to get companies and securities brokers to comply with the new requirements, he indicated that any further postponement of the effective date of these rules is unlikely. Further delay in applying these long-needed regulations would be unfortunate, the Commissioner noted. He urged all affected companies and securities brokers to take early adÂ­ vantage of the extension in order to avoid the serious disadvantages of failure to qualify.,State of California, Commissioner of Corporations, Press Release, issued April 27, 1969.","Registration, Disclosure",No,More,"The adjustments to the securities laws implemented by Anthony R. Pierno, California Commissioner of Corporations, increased the regulatory burden on companies and securities brokers by extending the deadline for the qualification of securities for over-the-counter trading.

This rule pertains to records to be kept and financial statements to be filed by the broker-dealers.","Registration, Broker/Dealer, Fees, Disclosure",No,More,"The Securities Commissioner of South Carolina amended several Blue Sky rules and introduced a new one.

Inasmuch as the purchaser had shown that the corporation was organized and operating at the time of the sale, an exemption provision of the statute relating to stock sold prior to, or in connection with, incorporation was not applicable. Moreover, where the defense is based upon a Blue Sky Law exemption, the burden of proving the existence of the exemption was upon the party raising the defense.",Exemption,No,More,"This evaluation reveals an increase in the stringency of Blue Sky Laws, notably in the area of exemption. The burden of proof now lies with the seller to exhibit the existence of a qualifying exemption under Blue Sky Law, meaning businesses must exercise greater diligence and thoroughness when claiming exemptions during transactions involving corporate stock. Overall, this could result in more transparency and disclosure while adding complexity and requirements for corporations partaking in stock sales.",1

In practice, this reduces the regulatory burden on companies issuing these instruments. However, it may result in less information for potential investors, as these thrift notes are now outside the purview of Georgia's securities regulations.",-1
984,343,1967,3,6,georgia,"Because material submitted to the Georgiaâs attorney general concerning a so-called  Employee Thrift Plan  was insufficient, no determination could be made as to whether or not the plan was an exempt transaction under the Georgia Securities Act. The plan authorized an employer to deduct a percentage of an employee's total wages and pay the amount deducted to a trustee who placed it into two trust funds. One fund was invested in the company's common stocks. The other was invested in the common stocks of other companies. No showing was made as to whether or not the companies whose stocks were purchased were listed with national stock exchanges approved by the Securities Commissioner. Consequently, it could not be determined whether or not the securities purchased were exempt.","Exemption, Disclosure",No,Neutral,"The submitted material concerning the Employee Thrift Plan was categorized as 'undetermined' under the Georgia Securities Act, due to insufficient information for an exemption determination. The lack of disclosure on whether the companies whose stocks were purchased were listed on approved national stock exchanges further inhibits an exemption analysis.

Importantly, pursuing the case under the common-law fraud action allows purchasers of securities to seek redress for fraudulent misrepresentations for an extended period of six years, compared with the two-year limit under the Blue Sky Law.

It does not tighten rules or case a lightening of regulations, but offers a pathway for potential investors to gain insight, showing its relevance primarily to broker-dealers and security issuers rather than the banking sector.

Rather, it dictates the behavior of fiduciaries, stipulating a certain level of care and discretion in investment activity.
